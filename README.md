# 🌐 Multiple Pages Website using Next.js

This project showcases building a multi-page website using Next.js in two versions:

- The first version uses **traditional CSS** for styling and is deployed live.  
- The second version uses **Tailwind CSS** for a fully responsive and maintainable design, with source code available on GitHub.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the same multi-page website built twice to compare styling methods:

1. **Next.js + Normal CSS:**  
   - Uses classic CSS files for styling  
   - Manual handling of responsiveness  
   - Deployed and accessible online

2. **Next.js + Tailwind CSS:**  
   - Uses Tailwind CSS utility classes  
   - Responsive design with minimal custom CSS  
   - Easier maintenance and scalability  
   - Source code available on GitHub

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Next.js – React-based framework for server-side rendering and routing  
- CSS – Traditional stylesheet approach  
- Tailwind CSS – Utility-first CSS framework for responsive design
